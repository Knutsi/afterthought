# Notes for Claude

## Allowed Build Commands

You can run the following commands to verify code:
- `npm run build` - Build the project
- `npm run tauri build` - Build the Tauri application
- `tsc --noEmit` - Type check without emitting files

**DO NOT** run the dev server (`npm run dev`) as it requires user interaction.
