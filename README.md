# Afterthought

An afterthought after a personal failiure of time management: "How would I manage my tasks?"

Afterthought is a survival tool to manage an increasing amount of tasks in my life, and the building need to understand what those tasks mean in terms of time and effort. 

- Todo-apps are to linear and list focused. Tasks are not linear until they are highly organized and understood, and often they take a long time to get them to that state. Tasks are a graph or things, and graphs are great at many things.

- Tasks build and swell over time, and when you need to focus on just a few, needing to open the full backlog is demotivating.

- Often a text editor like Neovim or Noteplad++ is enough and the best way, but sometimes not. As tasks are added to a plaintext file, you soon need to manage more of them than you can fit in a screen or two.

- On collaborations, we actually use state machines. So why not show the truth and make those machines "first class citizens" of our projects? Nuts, bolts, gears and all.

- Most state management can be local to your computer or some basic sync service.  

- You tasks often fall into fully separate domains: work, personal + maybe a few more. Todo apps fail to recognize this separation.

- Remember drag-and-drop, icons, menubars and double clicks? Those were great! (and we still use them for the stuff that really matters for productivty). The graphical UX that evolved int he decades of the 80s, 90s and 00s feels like it's slowly dying, but something is lost if it does. They allow for abstractions on the UI that empower users that have climbed the learning curve. You manage your tasks every day - if you use a program every day, it should be powerful.
