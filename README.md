# Afterthought

An afterthought after a personal failiure of time management: "How would I manage my tasks?"

Afterthought is a survival tool to manage an increasing amount of tasks in my life, and the building need to understand what those tasks mean in terms of time and effort. 

- Todo-apps are to linear and list focused. Tasks are not linear until they are highly organized and understood, and often they take a long time to get them to that state. Tasks are a graph or things, and graphs are great at many things.

- Tasks build and swell over time, and when you need to focus on just a few, needing to open the full backlog is demotivating.

- Often a text editor like Neovim is enough and the best way, but sometimes not. As tasks are added to a plaintext file, you soon need to manage more of them than you can fit in a screen or two.

- On collaborations, we actually use state machines. So why not show the truth and make those machines "first class citizens" of our projects? Nuts, bolts, gears and all.
